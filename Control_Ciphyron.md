## Tips
### Azure Herald
  - This deck is the weakest in the early game and you will be taking some real damage.
  It is recommended to keep **Azure Herald** in your hand when you are against aggro, tempo or burn decks.
  Also, keep **Azure Herald** in your hand if you know you will be fighting big minions.
    

### Lightbender
  - If you think your opponent is going to out value you, you should keep **Lightbender** in your hand.
  Keep it when you are against **Obelysk**, **Cataclysmic Fault**, **Creep**, **Primal Flourish** or **Xor'Xuul** decks.
    
    
### Riftwalker
  - Keep **Riftwalker** when against **Lilithe**, **Ragnora** or **Reva**.
  **Riftwalker** helps you remove far threats like **Eggs**, **Heartseekers** or mass **Wraithlings**.
  It is recommended to play this early to intensify the damage
  so that you can deal with a **Furiosa** combo, **Eggs** or **Heartseekers** with **Mythron Wanderer** buff.
  You can also use **Riftwalker** to destroy artifacts.
    

### Fifth Canopic
  - If your opponent is **Faie**, **Ragnora** or **Reva**, always keep **Fifth Canopic** in your hand.
  Do not replace this card at all. Play this card and they will be in a very bad spot.
  Also, **Fifth Canopic** has a 4/8 body, immune to **Plasma Storm** and survives one **Homeostatic Rebuke** so keeping this when against **Magmar** is also a good idea.
  
  
### Sunset Paragon
  - **Sunset Paragon** is very strong against minions with higher attack than its health or minions with even stats `2/2` or `7/7`.
  Therefore, it is recommended to keep **Sunset Paragon** when against **Vetruvian's Dervishes** or **Abyssian's Wraithlings**.


### Aymara Healer
  - Important to keep **Aymara Healer** when you think you will be taking big damage as it keeps you healthy in the late game.
  In the late game, when your opponent might be low in health, **Aymara Healer** serves as a big threat as it deals 5 damage to them upon its death.
  Recommended to keep this when against **Abyssian** as they do not have Transformation spells which means they have to trigger **Aymara Healer's** Dying Wish.
  Also recommended to keep this against **Magmar**.
  As long as they do not having cards like **Thumping Wave**, they'd have to think twice before using **Natural Selection** or **Homeostatic Rebuke**.

  
### Grapnel Paradigm
  - Good to keep **Grapnel Paradigm** against **Maehv's Husks**, **Starhorn's Decimus** or perhaps swarm decks.
  Works very well with **Ciphyron's** Bloodbound Spell.


### EMP
  - **EMP** is extremely powerful against artifact, buff or wall decks.
  It is recommended to keep at least 1 **EMP** in your hand throughout the game.


### Blood of Air
  - A very valuable card in your hand,
  **Blood of Air** is a Transformation spell that transform any enemy minion into a `2/2` **Wind Dervish**.
  This means you can get rid off a big threat and use the `2/2` **Wind Dervish** to kill a small threat.
  Since **Blood of Air** is a Transformation spell, it does not trigger Dying Wish or Deathwatch effects.


### Superior Mirage
  - **Superior Mirage** is in this deck for only a reason, **Makantor Warbeast**.
  Therefore, having **Superior Mirage** in your hand would give you an advantage over **Magmar**.
  You can also use **Superior Mirage** for cards like **Inquisitor Kron** or **Dustdrinker**.


## Early game
  - Play defensively and try to develop a board.
  Usually using **Scion's First Wish** to trade and keeping your minions alive at the same time.


## Mid game
  - Just. Live.
  
  
## Late game
  - This is when you can start being a little aggressive with **Fifth Canopic**, **Aymara Healer** or **Grapnel Paradigm**.
  You don't have to go aggro if you are half dead. In fact, it is not recommended.


## Overview
  - You are weak in the early game, strong in the late game.
  You have a higher chance of defeat if you do not have a turn 1 or a turn 2 play. This has happened to me frequently.
